<title> Lack of Diversity in Management Positions </title>
  <body>
      I will be researching and showing the results on the topic of diversity in management positions in specific African Americans. As someone who has been around Africam Amerixan communities, the lack of African Americams in leadership positions is discoruaging to the community as a whole. Sometimes with no hope  to achieve these postions with the benefits and financial security that they present, African Americans are left hopeless and choose to do other things to achieve what these jobs present. As kids and especially entering adulthood, if African Americans strive to be rich and at the top of their field, due to the lack of diversity in management positions, they feel there is no way to climb to the top through conventional means of school, and feel like the ceiling is a corporate office job working under a boss and not being able to realisitcally be at the top. There would realistically be a cap, so they therefore are led to much more dangerous ways to achieve this sort of financial freedom and success and resort to selling drugs and illegal activity. College is looked at as not as worth it as criminal life, which leads to many blacks being dead or in jail. I want to point out trends not just to African Americans but also other minorities and show the lack of diversity and if this leads to a higher percentage of these members in jail for illegal money-making opportunities whether it be selling drugs, theft, or things such as fraud.
